No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'

He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well; but up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. As he readied himself for bed, the sound of his old partner's voice echoed in his head, occupying his thoughts moreso than any other. But Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He continued in his usual routine, outwardly unaffected by the recent oddity he had witnessed. However, there was a certain, almost-imperceptible nervousness which tinged Scrooge's demeanor as he sat down before the fire to take his dinner. It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. As he took his dinner in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with a chamber in the highest story of the building.",
